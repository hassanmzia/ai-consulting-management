# 🚀 Provento-Manager  

**A web application for startup acceleration and mentorship management**  

## 📌 Overview  

**Provento-Manager** was developed to address the needs of clients in startup acceleration programs and business mentorship. While working in **business consulting and startup acceleration**, I noticed a lack of **structured methodologies** for tracking mentorship impact. Many clients relied on spreadsheets and informal processes, leading to inefficiencies in decision-making.  

To solve this, I designed **Provento-Manager**, a practical solution that aligns business strategy with structured data analysis. The application provides a streamlined way to manage mentorships, consulting activities, and track business growth through a data-driven approach.  

With an **interactive dashboard**, companies, mentors, and consultants can efficiently monitor progress, track key performance indicators, and optimize decision-making.  

This is not just an application—it's a **methodological approach** to improving business acceleration and mentorship programs.
